# ArtistFIX Notes

## Connection to DynamoDB Tables

### Overview
The connection to DynamoDB tables in AWS is established through the `artistmanager` Lambda function. Here's how it works:

1. **Lambda Function**:
   - The `artistmanager` Lambda function is responsible for interacting with DynamoDB tables.
   - It contains the logic to query, insert, update, or delete artist data in DynamoDB.

2. **API Gateway**:
   - The API Gateway exposes endpoints (e.g., `/api/artist`) that allow the React frontend to communicate with the Lambda function.
   - When the frontend sends a request to the API Gateway, it triggers the Lambda function.

3. **DynamoDB Integration**:
   - Inside the Lambda function, AWS SDK is used to interact with DynamoDB tables.
   - For example, the `GET` request fetches artist data using the `artist_id` as a key, and the `POST` request updates or inserts artist data.

4. **React Frontend**:
   - React components use Axios to send requests to the API Gateway.
   - The `ArtistManager.js` file manages these API calls, ensuring the correct data is fetched or updated.

### Summary
This setup ensures that the React frontend dynamically fetches and updates artist data stored in DynamoDB via the Lambda function and API Gateway.

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- Backend deployment: Lambda function and API Gateway.
- React component updates: `Dashboard.jsx`, `CatalogPanel.jsx`, `AnalyticsPanel.jsx`, `SpotifyModule.js`, `MarketingHub.jsx`.

### Pending Work
- Test the React frontend to verify API integration.
- Clarify `.yaml` file deployment and generate one if needed.

### Priority Information
- Ensure React components interact seamlessly with the API.
- Test the application and address `.yaml` file deployment.
