aws ### Build Fixes - July 11, 2025

#### Key Changes:

1. **Created `src/context/AuthProvider.js`**:
   - Implemented `AuthProvider` to manage global authentication state.
   - Added `checkArtistGroup` for group membership validation.
   - Provided `login` and `logout` methods.

2. **Updated `src/hooks/useAuth.js`**:
   - Replaced self-contained hook with context-based implementation.
   - Ensures shared authentication state across components.

3. **Fixed Import Paths**:
   - Updated `useAuth` imports in `App.js` and `LandingPage.js`:
     ```javascript
     import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth';
     ```

4. **Wired Up `AuthProvider` in `index.js`**:
   - Wrapped `App` component with `AuthProvider`:
     ```javascript
     import { AuthProvider } from './context/AuthProvider';
     ```

5. **Deleted Mock Logic**:
   - Removed demo-specific login logic from `useAuth.js`.

#### Final Steps:
- Run the following commands to verify:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run build
  ```
- Test the application to ensure all routes and authentication features work correctly.

#### Notes:
- Ensure all files using `useAuth` import it from `../hooks/useAuth`.
- Validate API calls and group membership checks for production readiness.
