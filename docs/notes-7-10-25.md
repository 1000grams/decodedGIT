# Notes: July 10, 2025

## Tasks Completed
1. Refactored `authLogin.js` Lambda function to:
   - Authenticate users with Cognito.
   - Validate that users belong to the `artist` group.
   - Return a JWT token and user details upon successful login.

2. Updated `lambda-functions.yml` to:
   - Reference `authLogin.js` stored in S3.
   - Ensure valid YAML syntax and proper configuration for the `authLogin` Lambda function.

3. Verified and cleaned up CloudFormation templates for:
   - `AuthLoginFunction`.
   - `AuthSignupFunction`.
   - `SubscriptionCreateFunction`.

## Pending Tasks
1. Wire the backend (`authLogin.js`) to the frontend for seamless authentication.
2. Clean up any redundant or unused code in the backend and frontend.
3. Deploy the updated Lambda function and CloudFormation stack.
4. Test the end-to-end flow:
   - User login.
   - Group validation.
   - API Gateway integration.

## Next Steps
1. Automate the deployment process for the Lambda function and API Gateway.
2. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file.
3. Validate the frontend integration with the updated backend endpoints.

### Notes
- The `authLogin.js` Lambda function is located in `c:\decoded\cloudformation\lambda-src\`.
- The `lambda-functions.yml` file is located in `c:\decoded\cloudformation\`.
- Ensure the S3 bucket (`decodedmusic-lambda-code`) contains the latest `authLogin.js` file before deployment.

---

### Deployment Checklist
1. Upload `authLogin.js` to S3.
2. Deploy the CloudFormation stack using `lambda-functions.yml`.
3. Test the API Gateway endpoint for `/authLogin`.
4. Verify the frontend login flow.

---

### Additional Notes
- Ensure the `Environment` parameter in `lambda-functions.yml` is set to `prod` for production deployment.
- Use the `AuthLambdaRole` for all Lambda functions to maintain consistent permissions.
